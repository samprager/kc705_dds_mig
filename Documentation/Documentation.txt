Clock Generation Error Output:

[Place 30-575] Sub-optimal placement for a clock-capable IO pin and MMCM pair. If this sub optimal condition is acceptable for this design, you may use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint in the .xdc file to demote this message to a WARNING. However, the use of this override is highly discouraged. These examples can be used directly in the .xdc file to override this clock rule.

Fix:

http://www.xilinx.com/support/answers/60480.html

1) Open the implemented design and from the Tcl console perform the following:

>> report_drc -file pre_wa_drc_chk.rpt
This performs a DRC check and shows the DRC reported by write_bitstream.

>> route_design -unroute
Unroutes the entire design.

>> route_design -nets [get_nets example_clocks/clkin1]
Routes the net reported in the DRC error only.

>> set_property IS_ROUTE_FIXED 1 [get_nets example_clocks/clkin1]
Locks the net.

>> route_design
Routes the rest of the design.

>> report_drc -file post_wa_drc_chk.rpt
DRC error no longer reported.

2) Create a route constraint to add to the XDC file

>> get_property route [get_nets example_clocks/clkin1]
 { IOB_IBUF0 RIOI_I0 RIOI_ILOGIC0_D IOI_ILOGIC0_O RIOI_I2GCLK_TOP0  { HCLK_CMT_CK_IN0 CLK_HROW_BOT_R_CK_BUFG_CASCO22 CLK_HROW_BOT_R_CK_BUFG_CASCO22 CLK_HROW_BOT_R_CK_BUFG_CASCO22 CLK_BUFG_BUFGCTRL11_I0 }  HCLK_CMT_MUX_OUT_FREQ_REF0 HCLK_CMT_FREQ_REF_NS0 PLL_CLK_FREQ_BB_BUFOUT_NS0 MMCM_CLK_FREQ_BB_NS0 CMT_L_LOWER_B_CLK_FREQ_BB3 CMT_LR_LOWER_B_MMCM_CLKIN1 }  


3) Add an XDC constraint as follows:

set_property route 

{ IOB_IBUF0 RIOI_I0 RIOI_ILOGIC0_D IOI_ILOGIC0_O RIOI_I2GCLK_TOP0  { HCLK_CMT_CK_IN0 CLK_HROW_BOT_R_CK_BUFG_CASCO22 CLK_HROW_BOT_R_CK_BUFG_CASCO22 CLK_HROW_BOT_R_CK_BUFG_CASCO22 CLK_BUFG_BUFGCTRL11_I0 }  HCLK_CMT_MUX_OUT_FREQ_REF0 HCLK_CMT_FREQ_REF_NS0 PLL_CLK_FREQ_BB_BUFOUT_NS0 MMCM_CLK_FREQ_BB_NS0 CMT_L_LOWER_B_CLK_FREQ_BB3 CMT_LR_LOWER_B_MMCM_CLKIN1 } [get_nets example_clocks/clkin1]


Startup Sequence for proper triggering (Chirp):
1) Program with all DIP switches down
2) Switch DIP 1 up
3) Trigger ILA

States:
1) DIP 1 Down: Original DUC/DDC signal pipeline from example design
2) DIP 1 Up: Chirp Signal Pipeline
3) DIP 1 Up, DIP 3 Up: No output

GPIO LEDs:

gpio_led(3) <= ddc_duc_bypass;
gpio_led(4) <= pll_status;
gpio_led(5) <= mmcm_adac_locked;

Fix for Bitstream generation error:

Steps to get ILA Core to trigger (???)

Fix error: 
[Labtools 27-1395] Unable to arm ILA 'hw_ila_1'. The core clock is slow or no core clock connected for this ILA or the ILA core may not meet timing.

***SOLVED:***
MUST PROGRAM FPGA Initially with all DIP Switches DOWN
